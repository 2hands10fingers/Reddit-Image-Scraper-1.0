Scrapes Reddit images from any public subreddit by a user-specified date range.

#Introduction

Many tools scrape Reddit but don't give you the power to grab data on your terms. This changes things.

#How it Works

Use Python 3 to scrape any .jpg or .png images in the available subreddit (you can always add or remove file extension within the code). Simply run the program in terminal using <code>$ python3 RedditImageScraper.py</code> under the correct directory where RedditImageScraper.py is installed, enter your start and ending dates, then you will select any public subreddit of your choice, and *PRESTO*! you will begin downloading images.

#Installation

<strong>Manual</strong>

You can download this repository directly from GitHub and place the files where you want to run the program from.

<strong>Command Line</strong>


Type either one of these into you command line of choice:
<pre>$ pip install RedditImageScraper</pre> 
or
<pre>$ apt-get install RedditImageScraper</pre>
or
<pre>$ easy_install RedditImageScraper</pre>

RedditImageScraper uses epochs to work all around the world. You must also install the <strong>Delorean</strong> module in the same way you installed RedditImageScraper.

#Notes

Download speeds may vary depending on the length of your selected date range or Reddit's current performance. You will only be able to select the years 2005 (when Reddit was launched) through the current year.
